# Code availability

This directory contains the code availability materials for the accompanying manuscript. It stores the custom R scripts and supporting files used to generate the figures included in the paper. Each figure's code is organized in its respective subdirectory (for example, `fig1`, `fig2`, `fig3`).

Usage

- Install required R packages (requirements are listed in each script or an accompanying DESCRIPTION/requirements file).
- To reproduce a figure, run the R script(s) located in the corresponding `figX` folder (for example, `code/fig1/plot_fig1.R`).

Please cite the paper when reusing these scripts.
